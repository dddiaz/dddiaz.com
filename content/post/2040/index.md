I wanted to write down some of my thoughts of what I thought the year 2040 would be like. 
Some may be wildly wrong, but I thought it would be a fun exercise. 

# Biology

1. Genomics will be ubiquitous. You will discuss it at least once with your primary care team.

2. People will have their genome sequenced at birth.

3. Most people born will be cured of any possible genetic diseases.

4. Humans will create purely synthetic life.

5. Diet's won't matter. We will be able to consume medicine that can direct our bodies to lose weight.

6. We will have a way to extend life.

# Space

1. We will deploy humanoid robots on celestial bodies beyond Mars.

2. We will discover extra-terrestrial life that is living (it may be multi-cellular).

3. We will grow food on Mars.

# Technology

1. Computers / Cellphones will be obsolete.

2. A way to download knowledge.

3. All shipping will be autonomous.

4. We will have deployed a fusion reactor.

5. Holograms, please let there be holograms. Like from Star Wars for virtual communication.

# Society / U.S. / World

1. Mass migration to areas with less extreme weather events.

2. One or both major political parties in the U.S. will cease to exist.

3. The US will roll out its own digital currency.

4. A new amendment will be added to the U.S. Constitution.

5. A world super power will emerge from the African Continent.

6. The Great Firewall of China will cease to exist. 

# Conclusion

The truth is no one can really predict the future with much accuracy, least of all, 20 years from now. Regardless I hope you had fun with me, and this gave you some inspiration.
