# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This Hugo site organizes editable content inside `content/` (each post lives in its own folder with an `index.md` and optional `featured.*`). Layout overrides and shortcodes belong in `layouts/`. Reusable media, SCSS, and JS pipeline assets live under `assets/`, while pass-through files (favicons, robots.txt) go in `static/`. Global configuration is split across `config/_default`, and data-driven snippets live in `data/`. Build artifacts in `resources/` and `public/` are regenerated by Hugo; delete `public/` if you hit stale permission issues before rebuilding.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `hugo server -D`: start the live-reload dev server with drafts on port 1313; add `--bind 0.0.0.0` when using Codespaces.
- `hugo --gc --minify`: produce a production asset bundle, garbage-collecting old resources and minifying output.
- `hugo mod tidy`: refresh the Academic/Hugo module dependencies after updating the theme or Go version.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Author content in Markdown with YAML front matter using two-space indentation; keep slugs lowercase and hyphenated (`content/post/learned-in-2024/`). Image assets should be camel-cased or hyphenated and stored alongside the page that references them. When overriding templates, mirror the upstream directory structure inside `layouts/` to avoid breaking theme lookups. SCSS follows the theme's BEM-style class names—coordinate with existing blocks instead of introducing global selectors.

## Testing Guidelines
We do not maintain a separate unit-test suite; rely on Hugo's build checks. Run `hugo --panicOnWarning` before pushing to catch broken shortcodes, missing resources, or invalid front matter. Verify new or updated posts locally in both draft and published modes, and spot-check generated HTML in the `public/` directory for expected SEO metadata.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Commits follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) as seen in `git log`. Keep messages in the imperative mood and scoped to a single change. Pull requests should describe the user-facing impact, reference any relevant issues, and include before/after screenshots for visual tweaks. Note any new configuration knobs touched under `config/_default` so reviewers can validate deployment settings.
